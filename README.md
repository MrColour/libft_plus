# libft_plus

My extended version of the libft library.
I 'optimized' some of my functions so they may look weird, or different.
Some of these functions can preform up to three times as fast as the traditional ways to code them, see ft_bzero or ft_memcmp.
These however are still no match for the system C library but they are better than most implementations I have seen.

Made in collaboration with Aymen Kharroub (https://github.com/AymenTM). He defined extra functions and the binary tree functions, he also defined other functions not included here but that may be found in his github, huge props to him.
